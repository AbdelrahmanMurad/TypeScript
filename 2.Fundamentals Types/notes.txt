Basic Types [Built-in Types]
JavaScript          TypeScript  
• number            • any  
• string            • unknown  
• boolean           • never  
• null              • enum  
• undefined         • tuple  
• object
================================
So, Basic types are inferred dynamically in typescript when initialize it with a value.
================================
- Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, it includes all the built-in types in JavaScript (eg number, string, boolean, object, etc) as well as additional types (eg any, unknown, never, enum, tuple, etc).
- In TypeScript, we set the type of our variables by annotating them.
- The any type can represent any kind of value. It’s something we should avoid as much as possible because it defeats the purpose of using TypeScript in the first place. A variable of type any can take any kind of value!
- Tuples are fixed-length arrays where each element has a specific type. We often use them for representing two or three related values.
- Enums represent a list of related constants.
